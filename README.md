# imageReading-using-Python

the images are processed using opencv+python in this project
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

Write a function for reading in a list of images from a text file.

Specifically, the function should have a single argument, which is the path to the text file to be read. 

The text file contains filenames for multiple images (one per line), which are understood to be relative to the directory the text file is in. 

The function should return a list of absolute filenames to the images specified in the text file. Provide tests and documentation.
